# DefendTheBase
A game I initially created during my final year of High School as a school 
project.
The game has received some minor changes since high school. The last one was 
during my first year of university college when I added some arrays to the game.

When I created the game during high school, I had only very basic programming 
knowledge. I knew how to implement and use if statements and loops but I did not 
know how to use Lists or Arrays. 

# Game
The game is a top down shooter in which you have to defend your base against a 
horde of monsters. If you die or the base is destroyed you lose the game. 
Currently there is no endgame, the only thing you can do for now is to survive 
for as long as possible.

# Requirements
The game requires slick2D to run. The slick2D Game Library can be found at
